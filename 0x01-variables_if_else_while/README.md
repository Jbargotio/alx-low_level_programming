file 0-positive_or_negative.c-a source code that prints a variable n which is randomly assigned a number. Is positive if n>0,is zero if n==0 and is negative if n<0 <br />
file 1-last_digit.c- a source code that prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. If last digit is >5 and is greater than 5 is printed, if it is ==0 and is 0 is printed out and if it is <6 and not 0 and is less than 6 and not 0 is printed out. <br />
file 2-print_alphabet.c- a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using putchar.<br />
file 3-print_alphabets.c- a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase followed by a newline using putchar.<br />
file 4-print_alphabt.c- a program that prints the alphabet except q and e in lowercase followed by a newline using putchar.<br />
file 5-print_numbers.c- a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 followed by a newline.<br />
file 6-print_numberz.c- a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 followed by a newline.<br />
file 7-print_tebahpla.c- a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using putchar.<br />
file 8-print_base16.c- a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 followed by a newline using putchar.<br />
file 9-print_comb.c- a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by , followed by space using putchar. The numbers are printed in ascending order.<br />
file 100-print_comb3.c - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. <br />
file 101-print_comb4.c - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The three digits must be different. 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2. Print only the smallest combination of three digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits.<br />
file 102-print_comb5.c - A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. The numbers should range from 0 to 99. The two numbers should be separated by a space. All numbers should be printed with two digits and 1 should be printed as 01. The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order. 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1. <br />
